        <p>Html is not a programming language.The main body of the paragraph expands on supporting details for the topic statement. It can be done through facts, examples, anecdotes, or even the writer’s own analysis of the topic.It is essential that the supporting sentences stay on topic and clearly relate to the topic sentence’s main idea. If the supporting sentences are off-topic, the paragraph will not be coherent and clear.</p>
